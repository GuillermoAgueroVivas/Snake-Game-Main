- 👋 Hi, my name is Guillermo A.V! I am currently working in the Film Industry as a Motion Capture Technician. 
- I would like to one day be able to myself utilize code as a part of the bridge between art and technology. 
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D art as I am also a Texturing Artist. I have knowledge of software such as Maya, Substance Painter, Z-Brush, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python on a daily-basis. I hope to share any tool I make to eventually help artists in the industry do things more efficiently.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any sort of project that can teach me something new! Knowledge is power to improve my own skills.
